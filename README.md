audio-player-project
====================

Project for a python course


The idea is to write an audio player. It should have a simple GUI interface with the usual basic functionalities of every audio player, able to play most audio formats and also have a playlist and an equalizer. If I am able to figure it out in time for the deadline, I will add a visualization option of some kind.

For the first deadline, I think about having the overall look and feel of the GUI and it should also be able to play the known formats and have a rudimentary playlist.
